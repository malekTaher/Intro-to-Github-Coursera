# Intro-to-Github-Coursera
In this course, youâ€™ll learn how to keep track of the different versions of your code and configuration files using a popular version control system (VCS) called Git. We'll also go through how to setup an account with a service called GitHub so that you can create your very own remote repositories to store your code and configuration. 

I am editing the README file. Adding some more details about the project description.
